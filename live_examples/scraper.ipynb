      "Had to pull out a special beer to celebrate UK's win over LSU. Even if I don't like this beer, this is a good day! The beer pours a lot like a dry stout: very dark brown, nearly opaque, and with a firm, withstanding head formation and retention throughout. It's basically a black beer. Aromas are very deceiving comming from a black beer; with a heavy citrus hop nose and backup notes of pine, lemon-grass, and charcoal. The beer tastes similarly from the hop's side. But the beer has a different story too: the malts. The sweet malt character is very similar to the candy-sweet flavors found in Belgian Dark Strong beers -- but without the yeasty, peppery, phenolic twang. This beer is all American with a high attenuation rate and hop domination throughout. Though the hops side and malts side make the beer enjoyable, they may be two separate beers, caught in the same bottle and need much more melding together to do. As is, it's a firm DIPA with challenging malt character. Good beer, but time will surely do it some favors. But as American Strong Ales go, I prefer Arrogant Bastard.<br><br><i class=\"fa fa-file-text-o\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>&nbsp;<span class=\"muted\">1,400 characters</span><br><br><div><span class=\"muted\"><a href=\"/community/members/beerchitect.14442/\" class=\"username\">BEERchitect</a>, <a href=\"/beer/profile/147/38470/?ba=BEERchitect#review\">Oct 18, 2007</a></span></div></div></div><div id=\"rating_fullview_container\" class=\"user-comment\" ba-user=\"168458\"><div id=\"rating_fullview_user\"><div style=\"padding:3px; background:#E8E8E8;\"><a href=\"/community/members/biboergosum.168458/\" class=\"username\"><img src=\"https://cdn.beeradvocate.com/data/avatars/s/168/168458.jpg?1330550786\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\"  border=\"0\" alt=\"Photo of biboergosum\"></a></div></div><div id=\"rating_fullview_content_2\"><span class=\"BAscore_norm\">4.1</span><span class=\"rAvg_norm\">/5</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;rDev <span style=\"color:#990000;\">-2.8%</span><br><span class=\"muted\">look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5</span><br><br>12oz glass, on-tap at the Rhino in Missoula - saves me from lugging that particular bottle back across the border.<br />\n",

The beer pours a lot like a dry stout: very dark brown, nearly opaque, and with a firm, withstanding head formation and retention throughout. It's basically a black beer. Aromas are very deceiving comming from a black beer; with a heavy citrus hop nose and backup notes of pine, lemon-grass, and charcoal. The beer tastes similarly from the hop's side. But the beer has a different story too: the malts. The sweet malt character is very similar to the candy-sweet flavors found in Belgian Dark Strong beers -- but without the yeasty, peppery, phenolic twang. This beer is all American with a high attenuation rate and hop domination throughout. Though the hops side and malts side make the beer enjoyable, they may be two separate beers, caught in the same bottle and need much more melding together to do. As is, it's a firm DIPA with challenging malt character. Good beer, but time will surely do it some favors. But as American Strong Ales go, I prefer Arrogant Bastard.\",\n",

This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.     rDev  Growler from Stone after tasting it on tap.

The beer poured out as a dark black color with a generous brown head on top. The lacing looked pretty impressive as well. The smell of the beer was fully loaded with citrusy hops and roasted malts.

Nice thick head in the glass, taste is medium to full bodied. Hop heads delight with some smokiness flavor coming through. Super creamy and somehow well balanced.

      "Had to pull out a special beer to celebrate UK's win over LSU. Even if I don't like this beer, this is a good day! The beer pours a lot like a dry stout: very dark brown, nearly opaque, and with a firm, withstanding head formation and retention throughout. It's basically a black beer. Aromas are very deceiving comming from a black beer; with a heavy citrus hop nose and backup notes of pine, lemon-grass, and charcoal. The beer tastes similarly from the hop's side. But the beer has a different story too: the malts. The sweet malt character is very similar to the candy-sweet flavors found in Belgian Dark Strong beers -- but without the yeasty, peppery, phenolic twang. This beer is all American with a high attenuation rate and hop domination throughout. Though the hops side and malts side make the beer enjoyable, they may be two separate beers, caught in the same bottle and need much more melding together to do. As is, it's a firm DIPA with challenging malt character. Good beer, but time will surely do it some favors. But as American Strong Ales go, I prefer Arrogant Bastard.     rDev  12oz glass, on-tap at the Rhino in Missoula - saves me from lugging that particular bottle back across the border. \n",

      "It smells like a creamsicle - semi-sweet orange and grapefruit, and milky caramel malt - before a huge dose of burnt cocoa comes barging in through the door, along with some bitter pine and leafy hop friends. The taste is more creamy, grainy caramel malt, now acridly tangy citrus peel, smoky wood, a bit of sneaky booze, and rather peppy spruce and piney hops.  \n",
